# Cross the River

A two-player game made using Python and Pygame.

**About the Game:**
There is a river with 5 partitions. There are two players in the game, one starts from top and the other from the bottom (the river banks). There are moving obstacles in the river(tree branches, crocodiles and the famous river dragon :P) and stationary obstacles on the partitions(trees, fires, cacti, snake and the King of the Jungle(lion, I mean)). The players play alternately for 5 rounds. If a player touches any obstacle, he dies. As a player crosses an obstacle his score increases as follows:
5 point for stationary obstacles
10 points for moving obstacles
There is also a bonus score that starts from 30 for each player in each round and this score reduces by 1 every second until the player reaches the "END". If the player dies this bonus becomes -15. Bonus is added to score of the player after he finishes his turn.
The next player starts playing after the current player either dies or reaches the "END". Speed of moving obstacles increases for the player who wins the previous round.  
Final winner is declared at the end of Round 5 and the game is over.
